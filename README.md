# Fintual Portfolio

Exercise-like project to reach Fintual interview.

Project itself do nothing, it just can run tests to prove portfolio functionality.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/cristobalgvera/fintual-portfolio.git

# Open project folder
cd fintual-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install # yarn

# Run tests
npm test # yarn test
```

## Disclaimer

I don't really know how to calculate annualized profit or even cumulative profit,
obviously I did my research about it, but maybe the implementation has calculation
related problems.
